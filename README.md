## üìñ What is the 42 Piscine?

The 42 Piscine is an intensive 4-week C programming bootcamp that serves as the entrance examination for 42 School. Students work through progressively challenging exercises covering:

- **Days 0-1**: Shell scripting and Unix basics
- **Days 2-4**: Basic C programming, loops, and functions
- **Days 5-9**: Advanced string manipulation and memory management
- **Days 10-13**: Data structures and complex algorithms

## üéì Learning Path

### üü¢ Beginner Level (Days 0-4)
- Basic output functions (`ft_print_alphabet`, `ft_print_numbers`)
- String manipulation (`ft_strlen`, `ft_strcmp`)
- Pointer fundamentals (`ft_swap`)
- Simple algorithms (`ft_fibonacci`)

### üü° Intermediate Level (Days 5-9)
- Dynamic memory allocation (`ft_strdup`)
- Command line arguments (`ft_print_program_name`)
- Array manipulation (`ft_rev_int_tab`)
- String parsing (`ft_atoi`, `ft_split`)

### üî¥ Advanced Level (Days 10-13)
- Linked list operations (`ft_list_push_front`, `ft_list_size`)
- Memory management (`ft_create_elem`)
- Binary tree structures (`btree_create_node`)
- Complex data structure algorithms
